-- HEY, LOOK HERE! This is called a comment!

-- A comment is text that the database ignores when you run your SQL code

-- You can use comments to leave notes in your SQL code

-- You'll learn more about comments later, but feel free to use them when writing your SQL code if you'd like.

-- All you need to do is type -- at the beginning of your comment. This tells the database to ignore it!
